# My-First-Analytics-Adventure
*My First Adventure into Real World Data Analytics using data from the [School Finance Indicators Database](https://www.schoolfinancedata.org), specifcally the District Cost Database.* 

I was fortunate enough to be a part of two open research groups as part of the [Data Science and Analytics Unit](https://lib.asu.edu/data) at the Hayden Library at Arizona State University.

This project in particular was an opportunity of a lifetime to do two things I've always wanted to do: Improve my analytical skills through real life analysis, and do research on educational data. To be able to do these things with the guidance and mentorship of incredible Analysts and Data Scientists at the Hayden Library was an incredible gift and I thank them for all of their effort in providing such a resource to students. 

While this analysis was challenging, messy, and certainly not perfect, I can confidently say that I am a better Analyst because of it. I am using this notebook as a reflection on the lessons that I learned and the mistakes that I made. I hope you enjoy some of the insights, consider what could be done further, and forgive me for my mistakes!
